# GuidebookButton
GuidebookButton is a minecraft mod addon for the mod [Patchouli](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/patchouli-fabric) which adds a button to visit all patchouli books.

This mod is a direct descendant of [PatchouliButton](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/patchoulibutton) by Globox_Z 

Please check out their work but don't ask them for support on this mod, they are a separate entity.

The major changes are the addition of a blacklist to hide Patchouli books added by other mods, and the inclusion of the ftb quests book.

### Installation
GuidebookButton is a mod built for the [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/). It requires [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) and [Cloth Config API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config) and [Patchouli](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/patchouli-fabric) to be installed separately; all other dependencies are installed with the mod.
